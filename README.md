# BookList
This is a program made to better learn the lambda and stream structure, which includes maps and lists. 


>The book class consists of variables such as book name, number of pages, author's name, publication date.

>Generate 10 objects from the Book class and store them in an ArrayList structure. write the stream structure and lambda expressions to create a new Map<String, String> with the author's name opposite the book name using the stream structure and lambda expressions.

>Make an improvement that filters books with a page count of more than 100 from this 10-element Book list and gives it as a new list. (You can use Stream and Lambda expressions.)
